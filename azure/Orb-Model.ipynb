    "# Orb Model Card\n",
    "\n",
    "## Details\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Orb is a universal interatomic potential for atomistic modelling of materials. Orb models are 3-6 times faster than existing universal potentials, stable under simulation for a range of out of distribution materials and, upon release, represented a 31% reduction in error over other methods on the Matbench Discovery benchmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Repo\n",
    "\n",
    "Orb is an open source model, made available under the license conditions found in this model card. Miore details can be found in the [orb-models github repo](https://github.com/orbital-materials/orb-models)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Capabities:\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate energies, forces & stresses of atomic systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intended Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Single point calculations, geometry optimisations, molecular dynamics simulations, and any other calculation involving energies, forces & stresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs/outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inputs\n",
    "Valid input mime types\n",
    "- `application/octet-stream`\n",
    "\n",
    "The input should be a binaryb stream from a valid CIF file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Outputs\n",
    "Valid output mime types\n",
    "- `application/json`\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is a json dictionary with the following keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Key        | Description          | Data Type |\n",
    "|------------|----------------------|-----------|\n",
    "| energy     | Scalar. The final energy of the system.  | Integer    |\n",
    "| forces     | Matrix. Dimensions of nx3 where n is number of atoms. Represents the force on each individual atom.  | Continuous(float)   |\n",
    "| stress     | 6-dimensional vector in Voigt notation. Represents the stress of the system.  | Continuous(float)   |\n",
    "\n",

    "## Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided an example workflow based on the Zeolite 4A.\n",

    "<span style=\"color:red\">The code for inference can be seen below.\n",
    "We need to finalizer how the model can be used from azure</span>\n",
